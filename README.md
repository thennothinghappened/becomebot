# What is this?
This is a program that allows you to use a bot as though they are a regular user for testing purposes, such as checking roles and permissions.
*Do not use this program outside this circumstance, as this could get you banned.*

# How do I run the program?
The first time you boot, it will create an empty file called `token`.
In this file, write the token of the bot you are using. Rerunning the program, the bot will be logged into.
