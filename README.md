# What is this?
This is a program that allows you to use a bot as though they are a regular user. Please note that this may be **against the TOS** so this could get you banned! Use at your own risk.

# How do I run the program?
The first time you boot, it will create a json file called `config.json`.
In this file, write the token of the bot you are using. Rerunning the program, the bot will be logged into.
